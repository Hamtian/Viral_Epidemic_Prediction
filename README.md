## Introduction

Hospitals worldwide face the continual challenge of managing infectious disease outbreaks, which pose significant risks to patients and staff alike. To address this challenge, this project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop early detection procedures for viral infections, enabling hospitals to implement timely and targeted contingency measures.

The primary objective is to build a binary classification model capable of accurately differentiating between infected and non-infected individuals based on demographic and clinical attributes. By doing so, we aim to provide hospitals with a valuable tool for early detection and intervention, thereby minimizing the spread of infectious diseases and optimizing patient care outcomes.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on patients and staff within a hospital setting, including demographic and clinical attributes. An overview of the explanatory variables is provided in the following table:

The target attribute indicates whether an individual is infected (1) or not infected (0).

## Exploratory data analysis and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science project, including data science projects aimed at predictive modeling, such as this one. It involves the initial exploration and examination of the dataset to gain insights into its structure, characteristics, and potential issues. EDA serves multiple purposes, including understanding the data at hand, identifying patterns and relationships, detecting anomalies or outliers, and determining the appropriate preprocessing steps needed to prepare the data for analysis and modeling.

Preprocessing, which often goes hand in hand with EDA, involves cleaning and transforming the data to address any issues identified during the exploratory phase. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing data imbalance, among other tasks. By conducting thorough preprocessing, we ensure that the data is in a suitable format for analysis and modeling, thus improving the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from our predictive models.

### Handling missing values

During the exploratory data analysis phase, it was observed that missing values in the dataset are indicated as "?" in certain columns. To facilitate data manipulation and analysis, the first step in handling missing values is to convert these "?" values to NaN (Not a Number) in Python. This allows for easier handling of missing data using existing functions and libraries.

Upon further investigation, it was determined that three columns in the dataset contain missing values. Each column was treated differently based on the nature of the missing values and the specific characteristics of the data. Various strategies were employed to handle missing values, including:

- **Replacing missing values**: For columns where missing values could be reasonably inferred or replaced, such as categorical variables with a predominant category, missing values were replaced with appropriate values. For example, the most frequent category or a specific value based on domain knowledge.
- **Dropping samples**: In cases where missing values could not be reliably imputed or replaced, and the number of missing values was small relative to the size of the dataset, samples containing missing values were dropped from the dataset. This approach helps maintain the integrity of the dataset while minimizing data loss.

After applying the appropriate strategies to handle missing values, a thorough check was conducted to ensure that no missing values remained in the dataset. This validation step is crucial to guarantee the integrity and quality of the data for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks.

By effectively addressing missing values in the dataset, we ensure that our analyses and predictive models are based on complete and reliable data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and validity of our results.

### Data Exploration and Visualization

In this section, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into the dataset's characteristics and identify potential patterns or trends that may inform our subsequent analyses and modeling efforts.

Let’s explore some examples. One aspect of interest in our dataset is whether the 'age' variable could serve as a good explanatory variable for our predictive models. We can visually examine this using some simple plots. By plotting a boxplot of 'age' grouped by the target variable, we observe any shifts or differences in the age distribution between different target groups. For example, a slight shift in the age distribution between groups suggests that 'age' might be a good predictor as shown below:

![boxplot](images/boxplot.png)

Alternatively, we can visualize the age distribution using a histogram overlaid with a density plot, providing a more detailed view of any shifts or differences between target groups:

![histogram](images/histogram.png)

By examining these visualizations, we can assess the potential predictive power of the 'age' variable and its relevance to our modeling efforts.

Similarly, we can explore categorical variables like 'speciality' to determine its predictive potential. We can visualize the distribution of 'speciality' categories across different target groups using a count plot:

![countplot](images/countplot.png)

By analyzing the count plot, we can identify any differences or patterns in the distribution of 'speciality' categories among target groups. Any noticeable distinctions suggest that the 'speciality' variable may carry valuable information for our predictive models, 
helping distinguish between different target outcomes.

Through these visual explorations, we gain valuable insights into potential explanatory variables and predictive features within our dataset, guiding our subsequent modeling efforts.

### Categorical variable encoding

In many real-world datasets, categorical variables play a significant role in capturing different aspects of the data. However, most machine learning algorithms require numerical input, which necessitates converting categorical variables into a suitable numerical format. This process, known as categorical variable encoding, allows us to represent categorical information in a way that can be effectively utilized by machine learning models.

- One common approach to encoding categorical variables is one-hot encoding, implemented in pandas using the ‘get_dummies()’ function. One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category in a categorical variable, with a value of 1 indicating the presence of that category and 0 indicating its absence. This method is straightforward to implement and works well for categorical variables with a small number of unique categories.
- Another approach to encoding categorical variables is binary encoding, implemented in the ‘category_encoders’ library using the ‘BinaryEncoder’ transformer. Binary encoding reduces the dimensionality of categorical variables by representing each category with binary digits. This method is particularly useful for categorical variables with a large number of unique categories, as it can significantly reduce the number of features in the dataset compared to one-hot encoding.

Both approaches have their advantages and may be suitable depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the machine learning task at hand. By experimenting with different encoding methods, we can determine the most effective approach for representing categorical variables in a format that enhances the performance of our machine-learning models.

### Data splitting

Data splitting is a critical step in machine learning model development, where we partition our dataset into separate subsets for training and testing purposes. This division allows us to assess the performance of our models on unseen data and evaluate their generalization ability. Here's why data splitting is essential:

- **Evaluation of Model Performance**: By splitting the data into training and testing sets, we can train our models on one subset and evaluate their performance on the other. This provides a more realistic assessment of how well our models will perform on new, unseen data.
- **Avoiding Overfitting**: Splitting the data helps prevent overfitting, where a model learns to memorize the training data rather than generalize to new data. By evaluating the model on a separate testing set, we can detect overfitting and ensure that the model's performance is not inflated.
- **Generalization Assessment**: Data splitting allows us to assess how well our models generalize to new data. A model that performs well on the testing set is more likely to generalize well to unseen data in real-world scenarios.

Before splitting the data, it's essential to visualize the distribution of the target variable to assess class imbalance. Class imbalance occurs when one class is significantly more prevalent than others in the dataset, which can skew model training and evaluation. We can visualize the distribution of the target variable using a bar plot:

![data distribution](images/datadist1.png)

Due to the presence of class imbalance, it's crucial to perform stratified splitting to ensure that the proportion of classes in the dataset remains consistent across the training and testing sets. Stratified splitting helps prevent one or more classes from being underrepresented in either split, reducing the risk of biased results during model evaluation. We can visualize the class distributions in both the training and testing sets to confirm that stratification was successful:

![data distribution](images/datadist2.png)

By visualizing the class distributions in both training and testing sets, we can ensure that our data-splitting strategy preserves the original class proportions and helps maintain the integrity of our analysis.

### Scaling

Scaling is a preprocessing step commonly applied to numerical features in machine learning pipelines. It involves transforming the features to a similar scale to facilitate model convergence and improve the performance of certain algorithms. Here's why scaling is important:

- **Algorithm Sensitivity**: Many machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and neural networks, are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Features with larger magnitudes can dominate the learning process, leading to suboptimal model performance.
- **Improved Convergence**: Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process. By bringing features to a similar scale, we can achieve faster convergence during optimization, resulting in more efficient and stable training.
- **Enhanced Interpretability**: Scaling does not change the relationship between features but ensures that the magnitude of each feature's effect on the model is consistent. This enhances the interpretability of model coefficients or feature importance scores.

It's crucial to perform scaling after splitting the data into training and testing sets. This ensures that information from the testing set does not influence the scaling process, which could lead to biased performance estimates.

By fitting the scalers only on the training data and then transforming both the training and testing data separately, we ensure that the scaling process is unbiased and accurately reflects the distribution of the data. Additionally, experimenting with different scaling techniques, such as ‘StandardScaler’ and ‘MinMaxScaler’, allows us to determine which approach works best for our specific dataset and modeling task.

### Principal component analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. It aims to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible. Here's why PCA is useful:

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA allows us to reduce the number of features (dimensions) in our dataset while retaining most of the original information. This can be beneficial for improving computational efficiency, reducing noise, and addressing multicollinearity.
- **Feature Extraction**: PCA can also be used as a feature extraction technique to identify the most important features or components that contribute to the variance in the data. These components can then be used as input features for machine learning models.

When performing PCA, it's essential to fit the PCA transformation only on the training data and then apply the same transformation to both the training and testing datasets. This ensures that information from the testing set does not influence the PCA transformation, providing an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.

Additionally, it's generally recommended to perform PCA on the scaled training dataset rather than the unscaled dataset. Scaling the data before PCA can lead to more meaningful and interpretable results, as it ensures that all features contribute equally to the principal components.

After performing PCA, it's common to visualize the explained variance ratio for each principal component. This provides insights into the amount of variance captured by each component. Additionally, plotting the cumulative explained variance ratio helps determine the number of principal components needed to retain a certain percentage of the total variance.

![Cumulative explained variance](images/pcac.png)

The plots illustrate that there is no distinct "elbow" in the cumulative explained variance ratio curve. However, it is noteworthy that approximately half of the components can collectively explain nearly 100% of the variance in the data. This observation suggests that we may be able to achieve significant dimensionality reduction by retaining only a subset of the principal components. Specifically, reducing the dimensionality by half could potentially capture a substantial portion of the dataset's variability while significantly reducing the number of features.
